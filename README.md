Description

Error Trapping generator

Tasks

Genererate Error Tapping where needed on .Frm .Cls .Bas. Counts lines in your program (Only what you typed) Generate a SQL stored Procedure list (SQL Only)

Special Features : Can select more than one file and it will generate/count/list stored procedures from selected files. It also know when to add or not a error trapping. So if you have 3 error trappings done by hand and you run this program, it will pass those 3 functions/subs and add the error trapping to the others.

A usefull tool I made when you got a lot of error trapping to do. It writes it directly on the selected files does more.

I decided to make it since i made a 35000 code lines program and error trapping was required almost everywhere. So there it is :) I hope you'll give some time for some feedback. Thank you for your time and I hope you will use this quite usefull tool.

I'll make a new version soon for people who make commercial programs with internet connection. My goal is to make a Error trapping generator witch send errors to a server (witch ill make) when errors occur on your developped program.

Enjoy :)
